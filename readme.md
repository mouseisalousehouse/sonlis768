# About Me

Hi! My name is Wesley. I am a student in my 4th semester at the iSchool, and am interested in archives. I came to the iSchool with the intention of going into the archives field, and that seems to be about where I'm headed still, despite all of the interesting topics the iSchool has thrown my way since then.

The URL for this document on my GitHub Repository is [here.](https://github.com/mouseisalousehouse/sonlis768/blob/080602c9ce6192b02556312047a000aedc4b35bb/readme.md)

## Some things I am interested in:

1. The contexts between archival items, and how they contribute to meaning
2. The material status of digitization and digital projects
3. Long-term preservation and documentation of digital objects (including DH projects)

## Tools/Methods I have learned in LIS 768:

- The basics of Python
- How a Git repository works in practice
- Some of the pitfalls and vistas of Data Analytics as a method of inquiry
